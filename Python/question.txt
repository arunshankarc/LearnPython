1) What is the difference between list and tuples

2) Write a program which takes a number an returns sum of numbers.
For example if number is 1000000 it should start from 1 until 999999 and sum every number.
What is the fastest and efficient way? 

3) Write a function my_for which is a most simplified version of for loop.
For example, when my_for("Hello") or my_for([1,2,3,4,5]) is invoked it iterates and prints each char or digit

4) Write a class which has polymorphism, inheritance and getters and setters.

5) What is GIL? how is multi threading and multi processing achieved?
